title: Why serverless? OODA!
---

## Why serverless?

Your [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) determines if you sink or swim.
If your OODA loop is fast, you can figure out what your customers want before you run out of money.
You can also recover from mistakes because they tend to be small.

## What does this have to do with serverless?
I've worked in both dev and ops.
I know how long it takes to "properly" set up a server.
I also know that they don't stay set for long.
DevOps tries to fix the problem.
Serverless eliminates it.

## Isn't this just a toy?

Yes it looks like a toy (for now).
So did EC2.
Disruptive innovation always looks like a toy at first.
Assume, for now, that this is only for new stuff.

## Join me on a journey?

I'm going to build some serverless apps.
I'll teach you what I learn along the way.
Gimme your email address so you can follow along.
