![Mind Map]({{site.url}}/assets/images/Great_Hacker.png)

So I started brainstorming what I thought were the qualities of a
great hacker, and I ended up with the above mind map.  It's
incomplete, almost certainly wrong, and absolutely will change, but
the details aren't important right now.  What is important to realize
is that the field is diverse, constantly changing, and notice that
only one of the branches refers to technical skills.  I think it's key
to understand this when doing any kind of assessment or planning when
it comes to ones own skills.

In the past year, I've been involved in networking, Rails, Java, XML,
SOAP, virtualization, and other technologies that I'm forgetting.
This list doesn't feel very interesting, and it's easy to think that I
don't know enough.  However, there's actually quite a lot of skill
there, and you could probably say the same about yourself.

If you have any ambition at all in this industry, that's going to be
the default state. Despite what you've accomplished already, there is
always something new to chase. I like that. What we need to do now is
harness that dissatisfaction and ambition for positive sustainable
growth.

I've defined four general growth tracks below based on my above
brainstorm:

1. The computer
2. The network
3. Other people
4. Yourself

In the coming posts, I'm going to get into how to assess where you
currently are, where you need to go, and what the immediate actions
are to achieve sustainable growth.

Thanks!
