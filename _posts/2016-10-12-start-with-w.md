title: Start with the need
---

Simon Sinek says we should [start with why](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447).
Simon Wardley says we should [start with where](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html).
Steven Covey says we should [begin with the end in mind](https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit2.php).
I ask: why are you starting at all?

One of the lessons of lean is that we need to pull rather than push work.

    There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all. ~Peter F. Drucker

Maybe the authors didn't mean it this way, but as we commonly understand it, this advice is about where to start pushing.
We don't want to push any more.
We're Lean Startups ;).

Before anything else start with the need.
Let that pull everything else out of you.
