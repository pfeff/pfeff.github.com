I want to take a minute to dig into the four fundamental categories I
listed in my last post. Here they are again:

1. The computer
2. The network
3. The self
4. Other People

The Computer
------------

The computer is our instrument.  We need to know how it works in order
to effectively practice our craft.  We can subdivide it further.

a. It's physical properties (Computer Architecture)
b. How it works (Operating systems and system software)
c. How to make it do what we want (programming and scripting)

The Network
-----------

It's been a while since you could write any interesting piece of
software in isolation.  Any interesting app now has to talk to other
apps or systems.  For our purposes, this essentially means TCP/IP
although there are some interesting short range point to point
technologies like Bluetooth.

Yourself
--------

We tend to focus almost exclusively on technical skills and we tend to
ignore our own health as it pertains to work performance. I believe
that you can't be a top performer unless you both physically and
mentally healthy. Serious athleticism isn't a requirement though.

It may not be immediately obvious how important physical and mental
health are, but consider for a moment how we rely on concentration and
clear thinking.  These in turn rely on us having a basic energy level
and being well rested.  As this is of particular interest to me,
expect a number of posts discussing the effects of diet, exercise, and
sleep on mental performance.

Other People
------------

Finally, other people provide our last area of focus.  This includes
co-workers, bosses, subordinates, and, most importantly, family and
friends.  Maintaining these healthy relationships is a difficult
balance, at least for me.  I find them to often be a source of
distraction from the task at and to larger goals.  However, they're
also a source of inspiration, and, in many ways, the reason we do what
we do.  I fully expect these topics to be the most difficult to write
and implement.
